## An Introduction ##
This is a basic Podomoro Clock presented in a simple web application.

## Before You Begin ##
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble the application:

* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.
* Redux - Refer to the [Redux Official Website](http://redux.js.org)
* React - One of the most cool libraries to build user interface web application. You can refer to the [React Official Website](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

## Prerequisites ##
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.

## Quick Install ##
The application comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` and files that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the application ##
The way to run the application:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Application should run on port 8080, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

That's it! Your application should be running.
